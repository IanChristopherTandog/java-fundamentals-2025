// The Java programming language has

// . Java programs will not compile if a variable is assigned a value of an incorrect type. This is a bug, specifically a type declaration bug.

// Bugs are dangerous! They cause our code to crash, or produce incorrect results. Static typing helps because bugs are caught during programming rather than during execution of the code.
