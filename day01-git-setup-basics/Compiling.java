//Compilation: Catching Errors
// Java is a compiled programming language, meaning the code we write in a .java file is transformed into byte code by a 
// compiler
// Preview: Docs Java compilers take Java source code and produce class files containing platform-neutral Java bytecode that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
//  before it is executed by the Java Virtual Machine on your computer.

// A compiler is a program that translates human-friendly programming languages into other programming languages that computers can execute.
