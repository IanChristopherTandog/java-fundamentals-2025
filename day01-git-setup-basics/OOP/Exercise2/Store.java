// Classes: Syntax
// 4 min
// Let’s explore how to define a class in Java. We will use a class called Car that represents a real-world car.

// The Car class in Java is defined like so:

// public class Car { 
//   // Empty Java Class 
// } 

// Copy to Clipboard

// In this example, a class named Car is defined with the public keyword. We’ll discuss what the keyword public means in a later exercise. Inside the body of the class, we can add fields to represent relevant information and functions to represent how this class can interact with other objects. We will fill out this class in later exercises.

// Let’s practice creating 
// classes
// Preview: Docs Loading link description
//  by creating a class to represent a store.

// Instructions
// Checkpoint 1 Passed
// 1.
// In the code editor, create a public class called Store.

// Checkpoint 2 Passed
// 2.
// Inside the Store class, create a method called public void buyItems().

// Keep the method body empty for now.

package OOP.Exercise2;

public class Store {
  public void buyItems(){
    
  }
}
