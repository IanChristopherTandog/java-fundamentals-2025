// Often our programs face questions that can only be answered with yes or no.

// Is the oven on? Is the light green? Did I eat breakfast?

// These questions are answered with a boolean, a type that references one of two values: true or false.

// We declare boolean 
// variables
// Preview: Docs Variables are used whenever thereâ€™s a need to store a piece of data and ensures code re-usability.
//  by using the keyword boolean before the variable name.
